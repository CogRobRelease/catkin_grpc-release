ros-melodic-grpc (0.0.6-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Depend on zlib (#23 <https://github.com/CogRob/catkin_grpc/issues/23>) and link protobuf with zlib (#22 <https://github.com/CogRob/catkin_grpc/issues/22>) (#24 <https://github.com/CogRob/catkin_grpc/issues/24>)
  * Depend on absolute path of .proto file (#21 <https://github.com/CogRob/catkin_grpc/issues/21>)
    This should fix #20 <https://github.com/CogRob/catkin_grpc/issues/20>. The original concern was for some reason cmake re-generate protos if .proto is not within src. Initial test shows this is not the case, but should do more tests.
